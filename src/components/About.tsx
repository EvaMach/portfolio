      <h2 className='mt-8'>About</h2>
      <p className='mb-4 lg:text-lg'>My path to IT has not been conventional. Although I have a Master&apos;s degree in Linguistics and English Language, I&apos;ve always felt drawn to technology. As a result I decided to take a job as a QA tester and discovered my <span className='font-semibold'>passion for ensuring quality and great user experience</span> in web applications. I explored UX/UI design for a while, conducting user interviews, usability testing, and creating prototypes. But soon, I realized that I want to bring those designs to life myself - and so I took the plunge into <span className='font-semibold'>frontend development.</span></p>
      <p className='mb-4 lg:text-lg'>I took the Czechitas Digital Academy intensive course in Web development which helped me transition into my current role as a Frontend Developer. Now, Iâ€™m very happy to be able to <span className='font-semibold'>transform creative, impactful ideas into user-friendly web applications.</span> Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges, explore latest technologies, and continue growing. ðŸš€</p>
