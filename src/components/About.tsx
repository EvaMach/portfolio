      <h2 className='mt-8'>About</h2>
      <p className='mb-4 lg:text-lg'>My path to IT has not been conventional. Although I have a Master&apos;s degree in Linguistics and English Language, I&apos;ve always felt a strong pull towards IT. After graduation I started working in QA, where I discovered my passion for ensuring quality and enhancing user experience in web applications. I dabbled in UX/UI design for a while, conducted user interviews and testing as well as creating wireframes and prototypes. But soon, I realized that I want to bring those designs to life myself - and so I took the plunge into frontend development.</p>
      <p className='mb-4 lg:text-lg'>I took the Czechitas Digital Academy intensive course in Web development which helped me transition into my current role as a Frontend Developer. Now, Iâ€™m thrilled to transform creative, impactful ideas into functional and user-friendly web applications. Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges, explore new technologies, and continue growing in this ever-evolving field. ðŸš€</p>
