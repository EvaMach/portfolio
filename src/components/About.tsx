      <h2 className='mt-12'>About</h2>
      <p className='mb-4 lg:text-lg text-justify'>My path to IT has not been conventional. Although I have a Master&apos;s degree in Linguistics and English Language, I&apos;ve always felt drawn to technology. As a result I decided to take a job as a tester and discovered that I really love collaborating on web apps that provide <span className='font-semibold'>quality and great user experience</span>. I explored UX/UI design for a while, conducting user interviews, usability testing, and creating prototypes. But soon, I realized that I want to be the one to code those designs - and so I dived headfirst into <span className='font-semibold'>frontend development.</span></p>
      <p className='mb-4 lg:text-lg text-justify'>I took the Czechitas Digital Academy intensive course in Web development which helped me transition into my current role as a frontend developer. Now, I enjoy <span className='font-semibold'>turning creative and impactful ideas into web applications.</span> Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges, explore latest technologies, and continue growing. ðŸš€</p>
