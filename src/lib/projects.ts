      "Beey is an AI powered online transcription platform that allows its users transcribe recordings, generate automatic or professional subtitles, create summaries, translate content, and more. I watched the project grow from a small tool centered around a rich-text editor with a media player into a robust platform used by thousands. Over time, it evolved to include numerous plugins and associated app like allowing voice recording, live stream transcription, or a powerful subtitle editor.",
      "I had the unique opportunity to grow alongside this project. Starting as the company's first full-time tester, I was free to establish testing processes and gradually automate some workflows using Cypress. My interest in user experience led me to take on a UI/UX design role before transitioning to frontend development, where I have remained since. For several months, I also served as the development team lead, working closely with the product team, but ultimately returned to hands-on development, where I thrive.",

Picture a conference where attendees can view live subtitles directly on their phones while a technician set ups the event - hooking up audio, connecting transcription models, and integrating translation engines.',

      "I initially took over this project alone, inheriting a basic vanilla JS prototype that needed a complete rewrite in order to be production ready. Opting for React and Ant Design (commonly used within the company), I restructured the codebase into a maintainable, modern application. Later, a more senior colleague joined, and together we expanded the appâ€™s functionalities. The project's smaller scale also allowed me to explore backend development, where I gained hands-on experience with Python and Flask."
